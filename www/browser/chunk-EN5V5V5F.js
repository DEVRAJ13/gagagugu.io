One day, a thief who knew the old miser\u2019s routine, waited for the old man to go back into his house. After it was dark, the thief went to the hiding place and took the gold. The next day, the old miser found that his treasure was missing and started crying loudly.

His neighbor heard the miser\u2019s cries and inquired about what happened. On learning what happened, the neighbor asked, \u201CWhy didn\u2019t you save the money inside the house? It would\u2019ve been easier to access the money when you had to buy something!\u201D
